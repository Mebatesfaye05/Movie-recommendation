## Overview

This is a movie recommendation system built using Python and Power BI. The system uses a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert movie genres into vectors, which are then used to calculate cosine similarities between movies. Based on these similarities, the system recommends similar movies for each movie in the dataset.

## Analysis

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the MovieLens 20M Dataset, which contains 20 million ratings for over 27,000 movies. The dataset was preprocessed to include only the movie title, genre, and release year.

### Genre Analysis

The most common genres in the dataset are Drama, Comedy, and Thriller. However, there are also several less common genres, such as Film-Noir and Documentary.

### Recommendation Analysis

The system recommends movies based on cosine similarities between their genres. The top 5 recommended movies for each movie in the dataset are shown below.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following:

- Increase the number of movies in the dataset to improve the accuracy of the recommendations.
- Use additional features, such as movie ratings and user profiles, to improve the recommendation system.
- Explore the use of deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, to improve the recommendation system.
